Synchronous

    - Each statement is processed line by line
    - awaits to resolve the previous line
    - each line blocks the execution of rest code
    - hence we call the Synchronous code as "Blocking Code"
    - it has to wait to finish certain execution
    - solution for this is asynchronous code

Asynchronous

    - asynchronous is also called as "Non-Blocking"
    - works in the background
